# Increasing Web Accessibility With ARIA: A Crash Course

Welcome! This repository contains all the files you'll need for the *Increasing Web Accessibility With ARIA: A Crash Course* workshop.

## Downloading all workshop files to your own computer
1. Click the green "Clone or Download" button (above this section, to the right).
2. Select the "Download ZIP" option, and designate a local destination for the zipped archive.
3. On your local machine, unzip the downloaded archive.

## Exercise Files
The exercises you'll be doing in the workshop will require files found in the **"dist"** directory, but don't worry about the details (we'll cover that in the workshop). For now, just make sure you have the files on the computer you'll be bringing to the workshop.

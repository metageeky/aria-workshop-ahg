# Increasing Web Accessibility With ARIA: A Crash Course

Welcome! This repository contains all the workshop files you'll need for our session. But, you will need to get them from GitHub on to the computer you'll be bringing along. How do you do that? Read on. 

## Downloading the workshop files to your computer
1. Click the green "Clone or download" button (above this section, to the right).
2. Select the "Download ZIP" option, and designate a local destination for the zipped archive.
3. On your local computer, navigate to the recently downloaded zipped archive, and unzip it.

## Exercise Files
The exercises you'll be doing in the workshop will require files found in the **"exercises"** directory, but don't worry about the details (we'll cover that in the workshop). For now, just make sure you have successfully downloaded the repository to the computer you'll be bringing to the workshop (by following the instructions in the preceding section).

## Improving a page's accessibility one step at a time 
Throughout the session, you'll be working on a web page to improve its overall accessibility. You can see the page (in the browser) in various states of improvement here:
